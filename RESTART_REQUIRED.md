# 🔄 Restart Required - Vite Configuration Updated

## ⚠️ Important Notice

The Vite configuration has been updated to fix host blocking issues. **All development servers must be restarted** to apply these changes.

## 🛠️ What Was Fixed

- **Host Blocking Issue**: Vite was blocking `*.local` hostnames
- **CORS Configuration**: Enhanced cross-origin request handling
- **Allowed Hosts**: Added support for `.local`, `localhost`, and `*.daza.ar` domains

## 🔄 How to Restart

### 1. Stop All Current Servers

```bash
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where ./dev.sh is running
# Or if running in background, find and kill the processes:
pkill -f "vite.*--host.*\.local"
```

### 2. Start Development Environment

```bash
cd daza.ar-env
./dev.sh
```

### 3. Verify Fix

After restart, you should see:

- ✅ No more "host not allowed" errors
- ✅ All sites accessible on their `.local` domains
- ✅ CORS errors resolved for cross-origin resources

## 🧪 Test These URLs After Restart

| Site       | URL                             | Expected Result               |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| CV         | `http://cv.local:3020/`         | ✅ Loads without host errors  |
| Navbar     | `http://navbar.local:3022/`     | ✅ No CORS errors, PDF works  |
| Onepager   | `http://onepager.local:3002/`   | ✅ Loads content successfully |
| Wallpapers | `http://wallpapers.local:3007/` | ✅ React app loads correctly  |

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If You Still See Host Errors:

```bash
# Check if any old processes are still running
ps aux | grep vite

# Kill any remaining vite processes
pkill -f vite

# Restart the development environment
./dev.sh
```

### If CORS Issues Persist:

- Check browser console for specific error messages
- Verify environment config is loaded: look for "🌍 Environment: development"
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) to clear cached resources

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know the fix is working when you see:

**Navbar Console Output:**

```
🌍 Environment: development
📍 Running on: navbar.local:3022
🔧 Development mode: Using local URLs
⚠️ Production fallback enabled for critical resources (including data)
🔄 Using production fallback for: cross-origin resource
🎉 Navbar rendered!
DazaNavbar: Auto-initialized successfully
Navbar initialized successfully
```

**No More Errors:**

- ~~`Blocked request. This host ("navbar.local") is not allowed.`~~
- ~~`Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 (Forbidden)`~~
- ~~`Access to script at 'http://navbar.local:3004/utils/downloadPdf.js' blocked by CORS policy`~~

## 🚀 Ready to Test

Once restarted, the environment configuration system will work correctly with:

- ✅ Environment detection
- ✅ Smart production fallback for cross-origin resources
- ✅ CORS-free operation
- ✅ Full functionality in both development and production

**Restart the servers now to apply these critical fixes!**

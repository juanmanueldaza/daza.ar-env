# daza.ar-env Project Bootstrapping & Iteration Briefing

## Overview
This document summarizes the key interactions, decisions, and actions taken to set up and iteratively improve the `daza.ar-env` monorepo, with a focus on automation, documentation, workflow, standards compliance, and the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for development assistance.

---

## Initial Setup
- **Monorepo Structure:** Established a monorepo with a `sites/` directory for all subprojects (cv, onepager, data, wallpapers, start, navbar, mdsite).
- **Vite Integration:** Unified all sites to use Vite for local development, each on a custom `.local` domain and port.
- **Automation:**
  - `setup.sh` automates repo cloning and `/etc/hosts` configuration for custom domains.
  - `dev.sh` starts all Vite servers and opens browser tabs for each site.
- **Minimal Dependencies:** Removed unnecessary packages, keeping the environment lean and maintainable.

---

## LLM-Assisted Development
- **AI Agent Involvement:**
  - Used a Large Language Model (LLM) agent (GitHub Copilot) to:
    - Analyze, refactor, and document code and workflow for KISS, SOLID, and CLEAN compliance.
    - Generate and refine shell scripts, GitHub issue templates, and documentation.
    - Automate repetitive tasks (issue creation, PRs, branch protection, etc.) using the GitHub CLI.
    - Provide best practices and open source standards alignment.
    - Summarize, brief, and document all major project decisions and actions.
- **Traceability:**
  - All LLM-generated changes were reviewed, committed, and tracked via issues, branches, and PRs.
  - LLM output was always validated for accuracy and compliance with project standards.

---

## Documentation & Standards
- **README.md:**
  - Provides a clear quick start, prerequisites, and troubleshooting.
  - Documents the branching strategy, workflow, and use of the GitHub CLI (`gh`).
  - Aligned with KISS, SOLID, and CLEAN principles.
- **Issue Templates:**
  - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_improvement.md` for rich, standards-aligned feature requests.
  - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/branch_workflow.md` for workflow/process documentation.
- **Branching Workflow:**
  - `main`: Stable, production-ready code.
  - `develop`: Integration branch for tested features.
  - `feature/*`: Short-lived branches for new features/fixes, branched from `develop`.

---

## GitHub & CLI Automation
- **Branch Protection:**
  - `main` branch protected (PRs required, can be relaxed for solo dev).
- **Issue & PR Management:**
  - Used `gh` CLI to create, label, assign, and close issues.
  - Opened, reviewed, and merged PRs using `gh` commands, with squash merges and branch deletion.
- **Commit Standards:**
  - Atomic, well-documented commits referencing issues.
  - Branch and commit naming conventions enforced.

---

## Iterative Improvements
- **Continuous Refinement:**
  - README.md and scripts updated for accuracy, clarity, and standards compliance.
  - All changes tracked via issues, branches, PRs, and reviews.
- **Solo Developer Adjustments:**
  - Branch protection rules adjusted for solo workflow (no required reviews).

---

## Key Learnings & Best Practices
- **Automation first:** Scripts and CLI usage minimize manual steps.
- **Documentation:** Rich templates and a detailed README ensure clarity for future contributors.
- **Open Source Standards:** All processes and code align with KISS, SOLID, CLEAN, and open source best practices.
- **Traceability:** Every change is tracked via issues, branches, PRs, and commit messages.
